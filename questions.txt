2) This compression technique would work well for shorter files, or files with a lot of repeating characters, such as dna sequencing. This compression type would work poorly on bigger files, or files that do not have many repeating characters, such as a book or story. 
3) The strong bias will compute best, because it is 90% likely to have the same character (0)
random: .625
strong: 2.44
weak: 1.174

4)10.06 minutes

5) 2.52 minutes. It takes a shorter amount of time because the code is comparing a lot less than it was, since it compares 10 characters at a time, and that it is very unlikely that 10 characters will exactly match, the code will run a lot faster by just moving through 10 characters at a time.
